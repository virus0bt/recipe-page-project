## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM class names

### What I learned

- How to organize simple website layout.
- Usage of CSS custom properties.
- How to work with Figma Prototypes and Design System.
- How to work with lists, basic and advanced.
- How to work with tables.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to learn more about accessibility and BEM naming convention in more complex designs. I also want to know more about advanced custome properties usage and new css features. I plan to spend more time on learning and comparing Flexbox and Grid, to feel comfortable with using both interchangeably.
